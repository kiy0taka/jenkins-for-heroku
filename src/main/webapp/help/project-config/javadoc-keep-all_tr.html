    If you check this option, Jenkins will retain javadoc for each successful build.
    This allows you to browser javadoc for older builds, at the expense of additional
    disk space requirement.

    <p>
    If you leave this option unchecked, Jenkins will only keep the latest javadoc,
    so older javadoc will be overwritten as new builds succeed.
