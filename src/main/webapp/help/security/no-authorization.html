  No authorization is performed. Everyone gets full control of Jenkins,
  including anonymous users who haven't signed on.

  <p>
  This is useful in situations where you run Jenkins in a trusted environment
  (such as a company intranet) and just want to use authentication for
  personalization support. In this way, if someone needs to make a quick
  change to Jenkins, they won't be forced to log in.
